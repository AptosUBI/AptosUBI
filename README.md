**Project Idea ‚Äì Universal Basic Income On Aptos Blockchain**

_Inspired by Daniel Larimer and his past research. [ DLR ]_

Vision for Aptos: The World's Most Production-Ready Blockchain **, rewarding its users universally.**

**Project category:** Social and Unexpected

**Purpose of work:**

Investigate and provide a decentralized, transparent and automated UBI for communities using APTOS blockchain technology.
A new decentralized protocol can periodically distribute some amount of income to every registered and verified participant in a community, ensuring fair, accessible and transparent distribution without intermediaries. This distribution can happen automatically based on the rules coded in the smart contract (point of discussion). Recipients can receive their funds as crypto tokens and can use these for transactions on APTOS blockchain or convert them into local currencies (another point of discussion).

**Impact and benefits:**

- Attract more common users to the APTOS ecosystem.

- Reduce poverty and provide a basic standard of living, especially in areas with economic instability or high unemployment.

- [ CRA ]: There has been plenty of research done on UBI in recent decades, and a great review of some of this research can be found in this report delivered by Stanford University‚Äôs Basic Income Lab. This report reviews 16 studies and concludes that the ‚Äúfindings are generally positive that UBI type programs alleviate poverty and improve health and education outcomes and that the effects on labor market participation are minimal.‚Äù

- Fiat-based UBI programs must rely on intermediaries such as banks or payment processors, blockchain-based UBI programs have no need for these middlemen organizations.

- Ensure security, speed and low fees using APTOS blockchain technology as well as fair distribution of tokens. APTOS ensures that these distributions can be executed for millions of people simultaneously, without slowing down the network or increasing fees.

- Smart contracts allow for the automation of UBI programs, which mean less humans need to be involved in the process, resulting in cost-savings, greater efficiency, and lower risk of human error.

- [ CRA ]: A UBI program that delivers payments in the form of a USD-pegged stablecoin, for example, could protect beneficiaries from the risk of inflation causing their savings to disappear overnight.

- The highly transparent nature of blockchain helps resolve this challenge by leaving an immutable, easily auditable record of transactions. All transactions ever made would be stored on the blockchain forever, and are tamper proof, making it easy to monitor exactly how much aid was given to each beneficiary while also reducing any fraud potential.

- This could include the launch of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) that govern UBI in the future.

- [ WKV ]: Implementing a universal basic income can potentially eliminate all or most poverty, and help to alleviate other social problems as well. Rates of suicides will likely decrease if a basic income is successfully implemented. Prevalence rates of some criminal behaviors will likely go down.

**Goals for this hackaton:**

- Explore and research existing UBI projects on other blockchains.

- Define purpose, identify benefits, challenges, principles, sources of funding.

- Code PoC on APTOS with basic UI.

**Identified main challenges:**

- [ WKV ] One of the largest potential problems that must be overcome to successfully implement a totally decentralized basic income cryptocurrency is that dishonest individuals may attempt to create many accounts in order to receive multiple distributions of tokens.

- Self-sovereign identity: To receive UBI, users would need to prove their identity. Blockchain enables decentralized identity systems, where individuals control their identity without needing a government or central institution to validate it. This system ensures that no one can register multiple identities fraudulently. Example: [ PSK ]

- Sustainable funding sources need to be established and managed on-chain. Integrating with traditional financial systems, regulation or tax collection might be necessary.

- The code managing funds and distributions must be extremely secure as vulnerabilities could lead to significant financial losses.

- Balancing system decentralization with the need for management and updates.

- Creating an interface simple enough for widespread adoption.

**Possible sources of sustainable funding for UBI:**

- Token issuance where a portion of new tokens on APTOS goes toward the UBI pool.

- Taxation on transaction fees, which could be pooled into the UBI fund.

- Creating a specific UBI token with controlled inflation.

- Using treasury funds in DeFi protocols to generate yields for UBI distribution.

- Funding from NFT royalties on APTOS blockchain.

- Donations and philanthropy from organizations, governments, or wealthy individuals committed to reducing global inequality.

**Key principles:**

- Unconditional Payments: UBI is distributed to all eligible individuals without any conditions, meaning it doesn't depend on employment, income, or social status. On the blockchain, smart contracts automate these payments.

- Decentralization: A decentralized platform or protocol distributes UBI, reducing reliance on centralized institutions like governments or banks. Participants can directly receive funds via wallets without intermediaries or bureaucracy.

- Transparency and Accountability: Blockchain ensures that the distribution process is fully transparent and traceable. Every transaction is recorded immutably, allowing the public to verify the distribution and ensure that everyone gets their fair share.

- Automation via Smart Contracts: Smart contracts on APTOS blockchain can automate the distribution of UBI at regular intervals without human intervention. The contract can execute predefined rules, ensuring consistent and timely payments.

- Tokenization of UBI: The income distributed can be in the form of cryptocurrencies or stablecoins, which recipients can use for transactions or convert into fiat money.
